        <h1>2023 Movie Ranking according to Clai<(￣︶￣)></h1>
        <h2>Top 3 Movies!!</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>John Wick 4</h3>
        <p>The action and the cinematography are just on point. This movie makes me feel excited till I forgot I have eaten all of my popcorn.</p>
        <h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
        <p>No words to describe this movie. The style, the art, the plot, everything is so aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <h3>Bird Box</h3>
        <p>One thing I love from this movie is that it never show us the monster, that way I don't have that post-horror-movie feeling and I can go to the bathroom without worrying HAHA.</p>
